### Upstream configuration for PHP FastCGI.

## Add as many servers as needed:
## Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Note that this configuration assumes by default that keepalive
## upstream connections are supported and that you have a Nginx
## version with the fair load balancer.

## Add as many servers as needed. Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Default upstream.
